#CryptoMirror

The CryptoMirror project explores ways to make crypto user-friendly in non crypto-friendly environments  

----
## Here are a few of the ideas floating around:
* Clipboard-like utility for creating messages for copy and pasting messages anywhere
* Accessibilty API hooks for receiving keys and messages from text in any program
* Fonts as secret keys which can render ciphertext into plaintext
* Screen-shot parsing for stegonagraphic image messages
* Curses interface for encrypted terminal sessions

----
## Usability tactics:
* Lazy trust evaluation for new peers               
* key pinning    
* ???
